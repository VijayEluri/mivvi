This wrapper will switch at runtime between JDIC and Java 6's
implementations of 'browse' and 'open', depending on
availability.

Java 6: It will use the included Desktop class.

Java 1.5 with JDIC available, including native classes: It will use JDIC

Java 1.5 without JDIC: It will produce an error box explaining what is
missing.

It needs to build with a 1.5 target against a 1.6 class
library.

It will need JDIC's jars installed in a local repository. Download
release 0.9 and install the jar with:

mvn install:install-file -DcreateChecksum=true -DgeneratePom=true -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=org.jdesktop -DartifactId=jdic -Dversion=0.9 -Dfile=jdic.jar
